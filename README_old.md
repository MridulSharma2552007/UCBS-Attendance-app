# UCBS Attendance App 😎📚

*A modern attendance system… because calling roll numbers manually is soooo 1998.*

Welcome to the **UCBS Attendance App**, a Flutter-based face-recognition attendance system that’s trying its best to look smarter than your average classroom.  
It uses **AI**, **camera magic**, **beautiful UI**, and a sprinkle of *“please don’t crash”* energy to mark attendance.

---

## 🤔 Why does this app exist?

Because:

- Teachers are tired of asking **“Roll number 23? Roll number 23?”**
- Students are tired of saying **“Present sir”** every morning
- And I’m tired of writing my name on paper like it's a **19th-century exam sheet**

So yeah… **technology win**.

## 🚀 Features (Work in Progress — don’t bully me)

### 🎭 Face Recognition Attendance  
The app literally looks at your face and goes:  
**“Yep, that’s him.”**

### 👥 Role Selection  
- Teachers see teacher things  
- Students see student things  
- Nobody sees *your crush’s* details — **privacy 100%**

### 🌚 Sexy Dark UI  
Dark mode so clean it can make your phone look expensive.

### 🧊 Glassmorphism Cards  
Because why not?  
If I’m suffering while coding, the UI better look premium.

### ⌨️ Typing Animation Instructions  
The app talks like a dramatic movie narrator.

### 📸 Camera Preview with Border Radius  
A sci-fi looking camera window so attendance feels futuristic.

## 😂 Known Issues

- Face scanner currently accepts *anyone*, including my neighbour’s cat  
- App crashes if you try to be too smart (working on it 💀)
